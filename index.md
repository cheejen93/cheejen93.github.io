## My First App with Kotlin

[Random Restaurant Picker](https://github.com/cheejen93/RandomRestaurantPicker)

I decided to make an Android app and I have always wanted to make something like this because my friends and I always had a hard time to decide on a place to eat all the time. With this app, you could put in suggestions from your friends and pick a random restaurant. Now, you don't have to worry about not knowing where to eat anymore!

## Maker Fridays IoT!

[NodeMCU devices setup](https://github.com/codycodes/gix-mkrfridays-iot)

Maker Fridays is a biweekly meetup by GIX MakerSpace Crew for students who currently do not have access to the MakerSpace due to the current COVID-19 situation. We know that students miss the place to build stuff and use all the different machines we have here. This project is for one of the Maker Fridays and we wanted to help student setup a NodeMCU as a platform for IoT application development at a low cost. We first help them to set up the NodeMCU with a servo that waves a hand that you could deploy at your friends' homes and can be controlled via a browser. Since the microcontroller is easily reprogrammable, we can always replace the servo with something else like a plush that would talk and that would be awesome! Show us what you make!
